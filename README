# Kaboom
Joshua Patrick(1495236) and Nicholas Serrano's() Final project for CMPUT274. It is an emulation of the Atari 2600 game Kaboom recreated on an Arduino. A head-to-head mode is also included to compete with your friends for a high score.


Notes: The scores are not properly being sent/read across the serial3 port for the loser of a head-to-head match but the winner does get the right scores so it kinda works.


Instructions on running code:
Plug in a single or two arduinos to seperate or the same computer. Upload the code to both arduinos using make upload in the parent directory. Play game.
