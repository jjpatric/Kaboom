# Kaboom
Joshua Patrick(1495236) and Nicholas Serrano's() Final project for CMPUT274. It is an emulation of the Atari 2600 game Kaboom recreated on an Arduino. A head-to-head mode is also included to compete with your friends for a high score.




Instructions on running code:
-Plug in a single or two arduinos to seperate or the same computer. Upload the code to both arduinos using make upload in the parent directory. Play game.
-Single player: Objective of game is to grab as many bombs as poosible without bombs touching the bottom of the screen. Player controls
blue cursor on bottom of screen with horizontal movement. Contact with bomb will cause bomb to disspaear and add 10 points to score
on top of screen. If bomb hits bottom of screen game over will be displayed along with score. To play again, hit reset on arduino
-Two player: Select head to head in main menu and arduino will be taken to waiting screen. Once two arduinos are on waiting screen,
game will begin and players can compete for high score. If one arduino loses first, other arduino will be able to keep playing until 
they lose. Once game is over for both, your score and other player score will be displayed and will say if player has won or lost or if
a tie has occured.
